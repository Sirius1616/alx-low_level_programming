Git Push to Remote Branch – How to Push a Local Branch to Origin

April 26, 2021
The basic command for pushing a local branch to a remote repository is git push.

This command has a variety of options and parameters you can pass to it, and in this article you'll learn the ones that you will use the most often.

How to push a local Git branch to Origin
If you run the simple command git push, Git will by default choose two more parameters for you: the remote repository to push to and the branch to push.

The general form of the command is this:

$ git push <remote> <branch>
By default, Git chooses origin for the remote and your current branch as the branch to push.

If your current branch is main, the command git push will supply the two default parameters—effectively running git push origin main.

In the example below, the origin remote is a GitHub repository, and the current branch is main:

(main)$ git remote -v 
origin  git@github.com:johnmosesman/burner-repo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:johnmosesman/burner-repo.git (push)

(main)$ git push
